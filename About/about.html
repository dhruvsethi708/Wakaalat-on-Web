    <!-- OUR VISION -->
    <div class="vision_part">
        <p class="vision_heading">Our Vision</p>
        <p class="vision">Hillwoods is a completely secular institution that instills into its students a deep regard
            for Indian traditions
            and customs. Children are free to practise any religion of their choice, and the school celebrates all major
            festivals with equal joy and reverence. Prayers from different religions are chanted on occasions like
            Gandhi
            Jayanti. The school believes in exposing children to diverse faiths and beliefs so that they may become
            responsible, cultured and dedicated individuals.

            It is therefore the primary aim of Hillwoodians to strive to bring out the best in themselves, not only in
            academics and sports arena, but more so in their character. Since children spend their formative years in
            school, the environment in which they grow up is of tremendous significance. At Hillwoods we seek to develop
            a
            sense of values and strength , committment and devotion in each student, and we seek to create an atmosphere
            of
            honesty, of intellectual curiosity essential to the unfettered blossoming of a young mind.</p>
